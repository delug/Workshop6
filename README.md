# Neural Models and Architectures

This workshop will cover the PyTorch implementation of support functions for properly training and testing PyTorch models, 
along with a lecture style discussion on a subset of modern neural architectures. As part of this discussion, we'll talk 
about research papers, their significance to the field, and some tips on how to read through and digest them.
